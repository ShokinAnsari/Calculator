# Calculator
How It Works
HTML: The structure includes an input field for the display and buttons for digits, operators, and actions (clear, delete, and calculate).

CSS: Styling is minimalistic with a dark theme. The buttons are arranged in a grid layout.

JavaScript: Functions handle appending values to the display, clearing the display, deleting the last character, and evaluating the expression.

How to Run
Save the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code in their respective files (index.html, styles.css, script.js).

Open the index.html file in your browser.

Use the calculator to perform basic arithmetic operations.
